* Set up project in a private github repository
* Outline what the application should be able to do (features etc.)
* Look into audio libraries

* Come up with simple use cases, based on features from yesterday.
* Sketch examples of a GUI representation.

## 12-06-2013 ##
* Start implementing the server while reading about select() on the OS
  level
* Make icons for the GUI
* Discuss what type of way to handle VoIP on the server alongside the
  main TCP thread

* The server can now accept multiple connections, and it lets select
  handle the waiting for the sockets readability/writability
* Start working on the client while thinking up smart ways to make it
  easy to put a GUI on top of it

## 14-06-2013 ##
* Slowly start implementing the protocol we agreed on earlier, in the
  server
* Start making the client API that the GUI will work with
